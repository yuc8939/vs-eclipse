Visual Studio 2019/2022 Eclipse Keymap

There is no Eclipse keymap in Visual Studio 2019, so I made this repo here with love.

Eclipse is the first IDE I used. Nowadays, although I'm not using Eclipse anymore, (I am currently using Intellij IDEA for Java development, Visual Studio for C++ and VSCode for JavaScript), I have set up Eclipse keymap in every IDE I use. My fingers and muscles have memory for this first keymap I have ever used, and I believe that this muscle memory is a source of productivity.

Please note that not all keys have been mapped, but only some very commonly used keymaps are included in this repo. Issues and Pull Requests are welcome. Hope this project helps.
