Visual Studio 2019 Eclipse Keymap

Eclipse is the first IDE I used. Nowadays, even though instead of Eclipse, I am using Intellij IDEA for Java development, but I need Eclipse keymap in every IDE I use.

I couldn't find any plugins for Eclipse keymap in Visual Studio 2019, this repo is here as a consequence. 
Only some very commonly used keys are included. Hope this project helps.
